<h3> The must incredible Steak </h3>
  <p> he restaurant from which this recipe originated is known for their AMAZING meals in North Iowa. I've had this recipe for years but have honestly never 'marinaded' with it. </p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ul>
      <li> Butter </li>
      <li> Steak </li>
      <li> Salt </li>
      <li> Garlic Powder </li>
      <li> Cube Chicken Bouillon, Crushed </li>
  </ul>
<h3> Directions </h3>
  <ol>
      <li> Stir the seasoning salt, garlic powder, Greek seasoning, and bouillon cube into the melted butter. Mix until the bouillon cube dissolves. Pour the marinade into a wide and shallow dish and place a steak of your choice into the marinade, turning to coat both sides. Cook or grill as desired. </li>   
  </ol>

  <h3> Cook's Note </h3>
    <p> I like to bake the steak in the marinade at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), ten minutes per side before finishing it on the grill. </p>
